Test reporting: Allure, ExtentReports

5. Web Automation
Essential skills:

Selenium WebDriver (deep understanding)

Page Object Model and Page Factory

Advanced locator strategies (CSS, XPath)

Handling dynamic elements, iframes, alerts

Synchronization strategies (Explicit waits)

Cross-browser testing

Headless browser testing

Selenium Grid for parallel execution

Browser DevTools for debugging

6. API Testing
Key tools and concepts:

REST Assured library

Postman/Newman

GraphQL testing

SOAP UI (for SOAP services)

Authentication mechanisms (OAuth, JWT, Basic Auth)

Contract testing (Pact)

API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

Performance testing of APIs (JMeter)

7. Performance Testing
Important tools and concepts:

JMeter (scripting, parameterization, correlation)

Gatling

Performance testing types (Load, Stress, Spike)

Performance metrics (Throughput, Response Time, Error Rate)

Analyzing results and bottlenecks

Distributed testing

8. CI/CD and DevOps
Must-know:

Jenkins pipeline scripting

GitHub Actions/GitLab CI

Docker basics

Kubernetes fundamentals

Infrastructure as Code (Terraform basics)

Monitoring tools (Grafana, Prometheus)

Artifact repositories (Nexus, Artifactory)

9. Database Testing
Key skills:

SQL (Advanced queries, joins, subqueries)

NoSQL basics (MongoDB, Cassandra)

JDBC for Java applications

Database testing strategies

ORM tools (Hibernate) testing considerations

10. System Design for Testability
Important concepts:

Designing scalable test frameworks

Test data management strategies

Test environment management

Test automation architecture

Microservices testing challenges

Contract testing in distributed systems

11. Behavioral Interview Preparation
Common areas to prepare:

STAR method for answering questions

Testing mindset questions

Conflict resolution scenarios

Leadership examples (even for IC roles)

Handling tight deadlines

Quality advocacy examples

12. Mock Interviews and Practice
Preparation strategy:

Do at least 10-15 mock interviews

Practice on Pramp, Interviewing.io

Record yourself answering questions

Time your coding solutions

Get feedback from peers

Study Plan (3-6 Months)
Month 1-2: Foundation Building
Core Java deep dive (2-3 hours daily)

Data Structures and Algorithms (3-4 hours daily)

Testing fundamentals (1 hour daily)

Month 3-4: Automation and Tools
Selenium WebDriver mastery

API testing tools

Build a test automation framework from scratch

Contribute to open-source testing projects

Month 5: System Design and Advanced Topics
Design scalable test frameworks

Performance testing

CI/CD integration

Review company-specific interview formats

Month 6: Interview Preparation
Mock interviews

Behavioral question practice

Company research

Resume refinement

Additional Tips:
Build a portfolio: Create GitHub repositories with your test frameworks, automation solutions.

Blog about testing: Share your learnings on Medium/Dev.to.

Attend meetups: Join testing communities, attend conferences.

Contribute: Fix bugs in open-source testing tools.

Stay updated: Follow testing trends (AI in testing, codeless automation).

Sample Interview Questions to Prepare:
Coding:
Implement a rate limiter

Design a data structure for a cache

Find the kth largest element in a stream

Validate a BST

Merge intervals

Testing:
How would you test a login page?

Design test cases for an e-commerce checkout flow

How would you automate a complex workflow with multiple dependencies?

Explain how you'd improve flaky tests in a large suite

Design a testing strategy for a microservices architecture

Behavioral:
Tell me about a time you found a critical bug late in the cycle

Describe a time you improved testing processes

How do you handle disagreements with developers about bug severity?

Tell me about a challenging testing problem you solved

Remember, big tech companies look for strong problem-solving skills, testing mindset, and the ability to write production-quality code. Balance your preparation between coding skills and testing expertise. Good luck!
