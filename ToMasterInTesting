 you have 2 years of experience as an SDET, know Selenium (Java), and hold an AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, you're in a great position to upskill in modern test automation & DevOps.

Here’s a step-by-step roadmap to help you master cutting-edge test automation while also expanding into DevOps for career growth.

🚀 Step 1: Strengthen Your Core Test Automation (Java)
Since you're already using Selenium with Java, focus on these advanced topics to become an Automation Architect:

📌 Must-Learn Topics in Java Test Automation
Skill	Why?	Resources
Selenium 4 (Advanced)	Parallel testing, Relative locators, Chrome DevTools integration	Selenium 4 Docs
TestNG (Deep Dive)	Data-driven testing, Retry mechanisms, Custom listeners	TestNG Guide
RestAssured (API Testing)	Automate REST APIs (JSON/XML)	RestAssured Docs
Appium (Mobile Automation)	Android/iOS testing with Java	Appium Docs
BDD (Cucumber + Java)	Behavior-Driven Testing	Cucumber-JVM
Playwright (Optional, but Trending)	Faster than Selenium, supports Java	Playwright Java
🔧 Recommended Projects
✔ Hybrid Framework (Selenium + TestNG + Maven + Extent Reports)
✔ API Automation Suite (RestAssured + TestNG)
✔ Mobile Test Automation (Appium + Selenium Grid)

☁ Step 2: Expand into DevOps (Since You Have AWS Cloud Practitioner)
Since you're interested in DevOps, here’s how to transition smoothly:

📌 Key DevOps Skills for SDETs
Skill	Why?	Resources
Docker	Containerize test automation frameworks	Docker for Testers
Jenkins/GitLab CI	Automate test execution in CI/CD	Jenkins Pipeline Tutorial
Kubernetes (Basics)	Scale Selenium Grid/Playwright tests	K8s for Testers
Infrastructure as Code (IaC)	Terraform for AWS test environments	Terraform AWS
AWS for Testing	Run tests on AWS Device Farm, Lambda	AWS Testing Docs
🔧 Recommended DevOps Projects
✔ Dockerize Selenium Tests (Run tests in containers)
✔ Jenkins Pipeline for Test Automation (Auto-trigger on Git push)
✔ AWS Lambda + API Gateway Testing (Serverless test automation)

🔥 Step 3: Learn Booming Test Automation Technologies (2024-25)
Since you asked about booming technologies, here are the top trends:

📌 Trending Test Automation Tools
Tool/Technology	Why Learn?	Best For
Playwright	Faster than Selenium, multi-language support	Web & Mobile Testing
Cypress	JS-based, great for frontend testing	Web Apps (React, Angular)
Karate DSL	API Testing + UI Automation in one	API & Web Automation
Taiko	Simple, reliable browser automation	JavaScript-based testing
AI/ML in Testing	Self-healing tests, visual testing	Future-proofing skills
🔧 What Should You Learn First?
If you want to stick with Java → Playwright (Java) + Karate DSL

If open to JavaScript → Cypress + Taiko

If interested in AI testing → Testim, Applitools

🎯 Step 4: Certification Path (Optional but Helpful)
Certification	Best For	Priority
AWS Certified Developer	DevOps + Cloud Testing	⭐⭐⭐⭐
Docker Certified Associate	Containerization	⭐⭐⭐
ISTQB Advanced (Test Automation)	Formal automation recognition	⭐⭐
Cypress/Playwright Certifications	Modern automation proof	⭐⭐⭐
📅 Your 6-Month Learning Plan
Month	Focus Area	Goal
Month 1-2	Advanced Selenium + API Testing	Build a hybrid framework
Month 3	DevOps (Docker + Jenkins)	Dockerize tests, CI/CD pipeline
Month 4	Playwright/Karate DSL	Migrate from Selenium
Month 5	AWS + Terraform	Run tests on cloud
Month 6	AI in Testing (Optional)	Explore self-healing tests
💡 Final Advice
Master Java automation first (Selenium, API, BDD).

Then, move into DevOps (Docker, Jenkins, AWS).

Finally, learn trending tools (Playwright, Cypress, AI testing).
